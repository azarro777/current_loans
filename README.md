Coding Test
You're going to code (the fun part!).
We’d like to get an idea about how you like to code and if it fits with how we like to code.
Please don’t spend on this task more than 6 hours. We don't expect anyone to create fully
working application in a such short time. Plan your work respectively. Show us how you
approach planning.
Exercise
We think everyone should have the opportunity to invest in property, which is
why we’re disrupting the status quo. This is lending and investing without the banks.
Mortgages simplified. We connect people who want to invest their money, with investments to
those who want to borrow.
One of the important parts of our business is to give our investors a way to invest in a loan for
them to earn a return (monthly interest payment).
